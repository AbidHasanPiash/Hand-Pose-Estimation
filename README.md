# Hand-Pose-Estimation
Hand pose estimation is the task of finding the joints of the hand from an image or set of video frames.
I used an existing method called Multiview Bootstrapping to find hand key-points. Then I added two features, one is drawing skeletons of hand and the other is the classification of all fingers.
